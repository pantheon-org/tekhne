# BDD Testing & Practices

Comprehensive Behavior-Driven Development guidance covering principles, collaboration practices, Gherkin syntax, and Cucumber.js implementation. Navigate to specific topics based on your needs.

## When to Apply

Use this skill when:
- Writing BDD scenarios or feature files
- Implementing Cucumber.js tests with TypeScript
- Facilitating Three Amigos or Example Mapping sessions
- Defining acceptance criteria for user stories
- Creating living documentation from tests
- Setting up BDD testing infrastructure
- Reviewing or refactoring existing BDD tests

## Categories by Priority

| Priority | Category | Impact | Prefix |
|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Principles & Philosophy | CRITICAL | `principles-` |
| 2 | Gherkin Syntax & Structure | CRITICAL | `gherkin-` |
| 3 | Collaboration Practices | HIGH | `collaboration-` |
| 4 | Scenario Writing | HIGH | `scenarios-` |
| 5 | Patterns & Anti-patterns | MEDIUM | `patterns-` |
| 6 | Cucumber.js Implementation | MEDIUM | `cucumber-` |

## How to Use

Read individual reference files for detailed guidance:

```
references/principles-core-philosophy.md
references/gherkin-syntax.md
references/collaboration-three-amigos.md
```

Each reference file contains:
- Core concepts and explanations
- Practical examples with code
- Best practices and common pitfalls
- When to apply specific techniques
- Related resources and links

## Progressive Disclosure

Start with **principles** to understand the BDD mindset, then explore **gherkin** for syntax, **collaboration** for team practices, and **cucumber** for implementation details.
