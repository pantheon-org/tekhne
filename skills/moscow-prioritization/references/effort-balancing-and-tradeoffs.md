# Effort Balancing and Tradeoffs

Use this guide after initial categorization.

## Target Distribution

- `Must`: 50-60% effort
- `Should`: 20-30% effort
- `Could`: 10-20% effort
- `Won't`: explicit exclusions

## Rebalance Rules

1. If `Must` > 60%, downgrade lowest-impact Must items.
2. If `Could` is empty, force explicit enhancement candidates.
3. If `Won't` is empty, add at least 3 deferred items.

## Tradeoff Examples

- Move advanced analytics from `Must` to `Should` to protect launch date.
- Move custom theming from `Should` to `Could` when staffing drops.
- Move legacy export format from `Could` to `Won't` when demand is low.

## Verification

Review the final mix with stakeholders and capture sign-off date.
