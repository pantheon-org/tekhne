# E-commerce Checkout Implementation

## Problem Description

Your team is building a new e-commerce platform for a mid-sized retail company. The product manager has identified that checkout abandonment is a major issue with their current system - users frequently leave during the payment process due to slow performance and unclear error handling. The company processes about 1,000 transactions per day and needs a robust, user-friendly checkout experience.

The development team has the basic shopping cart functionality complete, but the checkout flow needs to be clearly defined before implementation begins. The system needs to handle various payment methods, provide clear feedback to users, and perform reliably under normal load conditions.

## Output Specification

Create a comprehensive acceptance criteria document for the checkout flow feature. The document should include:

- User story with clear business value
- Complete acceptance criteria covering the checkout process
- Edge cases and error handling scenarios  
- Scope definition to guide development priorities

Save your work as `checkout-acceptance-criteria.md`.
