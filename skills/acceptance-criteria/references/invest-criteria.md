# INVEST Criteria

Use INVEST to evaluate story and acceptance-criteria quality.

## INVEST

- Independent: can be delivered without unrelated blockers.
- Negotiable: leaves room for implementation choices.
- Valuable: maps to user/business value.
- Estimable: clear enough to size confidently.
- Small: scoped for one iteration.
- Testable: acceptance checks are objective.

## Practical Check

For each criterion, ask:

- Is it observable?
- Is pass/fail unambiguous?
- Does it describe user outcome?
