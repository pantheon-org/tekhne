# Trends Analysis

Historical tracking and trend analysis for skill quality metrics over time.

## Overview

**Purpose**: Track skill collection health over time  
**Value**: Identify regressions early, measure improvement efforts  
**Frequency**: Weekly data points, monthly trend reports

## Data Collection

### Weekly Snapshot

```bash
# Generate weekly snapshot
./scripts/snapshot-metrics.sh
```

**Captured Data:**
- Total skill count
- Grade distribution
- Average score
- Duplication percentage
- File size statistics

### Snapshot Format

```json
