      DeepMind argues that next-generation AI agents will move beyond simple task
      automation to true autonomous reasoning and planning. The key breakthrough is
      combining large language models with symbolic reasoning and external tool use.
      This hybrid approach enables agents to handle complex, multi-step tasks while
      remaining interpretable and controllable.

      - "  - **Evidence / Quote:** Supporting quote or data"
      - "  - **Timestamp:** (for video/podcast) MM:SS"
    example: |
      - **Point 1: Hybrid AI Architecture**
        - **Why it matters:** Pure LLMs lack structured reasoning capabilities
        - **Evidence:** "We found that combining neural networks with symbolic 
          reasoning increased task success rate from 60% to 94%"
        - **Timestamp:** 3:45

      - **Point 2: Tool Integration is Critical**
        - **Why it matters:** Agents need to interact with external systems
        - **Evidence:** Demonstrated agents using calculators, APIs, and databases
        - **Timestamp:** 8:20

      - **Point 3: Safety Through Interpretability**
        - **Why it matters:** Enterprise adoption requires transparency

      - No discussion of computational costs - what's the performance overhead?
      - Claims about 94% success rate - what was the test set? Reproducible?
      - Missing: comparison with other approaches (ReAct, Chain-of-Thought)
      - Concern: Interpretability claims seem optimistic for complex tasks

# Best practices for article summaries
best_practices:
  - "Write Core Summary immediately after reading (captures first impression)"
  - "Use author's own words in quotes (with proper attribution)"
  - "Include timestamps for video/podcast (makes re-listening easier)"
  - "Be critical - note what's missing or questionable"
  - "Focus on actionable insights in Applications section"
  - "Link to related content you've already documented"
  - "Set concrete next steps in Personal Notes"
  - "For videos: screenshot key slides/diagrams if helpful"
  - "Update tags to match your taxonomy (not just article keywords)"
  - "Keep it scannable - use formatting liberally"

# Tone and style
style:
  tone: "Analytical and reflective"
  perspective: "Third-person for summary, first-person for notes/actions"
  focus: "Extracting actionable insights"
  length: "Varies by content (article: 500-800 words, video: 800-1200 words)"
  objectivity: "Summarize faithfully, critique separately"
