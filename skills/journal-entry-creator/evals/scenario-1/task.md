# Learning Documentation Task

## Problem/Feature Description

Your team is adopting a new containerization strategy for the microservices platform. After spending the last two weeks researching Docker multi-stage builds, Kubernetes deployment patterns, and container security best practices, you've gained valuable insights that need to be captured for the team.

You've discovered several key concepts including how multi-stage builds can reduce image sizes by 70%, the importance of using non-root users for security, and specific patterns for health checks and resource limits in Kubernetes. You also learned about some common pitfalls like forgetting to use .dockerignore files and the security implications of using latest tags.

The engineering team wants to build a knowledge base of these learnings so other developers can benefit from your research and avoid common mistakes when implementing similar containerization approaches.

## Output Specification

Create a learning documentation entry that captures:

- The key concepts and techniques discovered
- Practical examples or code snippets where relevant  
- Important gotchas or pitfalls to avoid
- Resources or references that were particularly helpful
- Next steps for applying this knowledge

The documentation should be structured for easy reference and knowledge sharing across the development team.
