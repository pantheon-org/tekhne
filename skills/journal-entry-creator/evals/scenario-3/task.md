# General Documentation Task

## Problem/Feature Description

Your team just completed the quarterly planning session where several important decisions were made about the upcoming product roadmap. The session covered technology stack decisions, resource allocation across different projects, and alignment on development priorities for the next three months.

Key decisions included adopting a new CI/CD pipeline tool, restructuring the development team into feature-focused squads, and establishing new code review processes. There were also discussions about technical debt priorities and infrastructure modernization efforts.

The engineering leadership wants to maintain a record of these strategic sessions for future reference and to track how decisions evolve over time. This documentation will be valuable for onboarding new team members and for quarterly retrospectives.

## Output Specification

Create a general documentation entry that captures:

- Key decisions and their rationale
- Action items and ownership assignments
- Timeline and milestone information  
- Any unresolved issues or follow-up items
- Context that will be helpful for future reference

The documentation should be well-organized and include appropriate metadata for easy searching and categorization within the team's knowledge base.
